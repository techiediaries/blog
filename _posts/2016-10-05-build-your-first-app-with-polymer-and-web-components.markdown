  This tutorial utilizes Polymer v1.x. Please keep in mind that Polymer v2 may differ. You can check the <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer documentation</a> for more details while we work to bring you a new tutorial that covers version 2 of the library.
</div>

**TL;DR:** [Google Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) is a library that provides syntactic sugar and polyfills for building elements and applications with [web components](http://webcomponents.org/). We'll build a web app using Polymer and its CLI, call an external API, and add authentication with [JSON Web Tokens](http://jwt.io). The full code is available at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/auth0-blog/polymer-with-jwt-api).

## What Are Web Components?

_Components_ are generally understood to be modular pieces of code that provide UI and/or scripting in a reusable package. Many JS frameworks use the term "components" (e.g., [Angular](http://learnangular2.com/components/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Component.html)). However, to understand Polymer, we'll do a quick crash-course on a specific kind of component: _web_ components. 

**Web components** are [reusable](http://webcomponents.org) [widgets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) that can be assembled like building blocks in web documents and apps. They are a set of browser features that are being added to the [W3C HTML and DOM specification](https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/components). A web component is composed of four standards: 

* [Custom Elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/)
* [HTML Templates](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element)
* [Shadow DOM](https://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/)
* [HTML Imports](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-imports/)

In a nutshell, web components allow us to architect and [import](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/) [custom elements](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/customelements/) that automatically associate JS behavior with [templates](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/template/) and can utilize [shadow DOM](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/shadowdom) to provide CSS scoping and DOM encapsulation. 

Web components can be used natively _without_ any additional libraries or toolsets. However, not all features are supported by all browsers. We need to leverage a library like **Polymer** or [polyfills, such as webcomponents.js](http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/), to bridge the gap between the current state of browser support and the future.

## Enter Google Polymer

**[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/)** is a library created by Google that enables us to build cross-browser compatible apps and elements with web components. It provides syntactic sugar to native web components as well as [polyfills for browsers](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/browsers) that don't support web components yet. Shadow DOM is difficult and costly to polyfill, so Polymer uses [shady DOM](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/blog/shadydom) to [implement the features of shadow DOM](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/blog/shadydom#shadow-dom-is-awesome-why-is-there-a-shady-dom) in browsers that lack support.

The [Polymer Element Catalog](https://elements.polymer-project.org/) provides many prepackaged [custom elements that can be easily implemented](https://elements.polymer-project.org/guides/using-elements) in any Polymer project. They provide useful utility elements like [Ajax](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-ajax), [media queries](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-media-query), and [single page application routing](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-route) as well as the [visual "Paper" elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=paper-elements) of [Google's Material Design](https://material.google.com/).

Polymer has comprehensive documentation at the [Polymer Project Devguide](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview) and can be used with or without the custom elements in the Element Catalog. To speed up development, we'll build our simple Single Page Application (SPA) with a starter kit and Polymer elements.

## What We'll Build

We're going to develop a Polymer app that does the following:

* calls an external Node API to get Chuck Norris quotes,
* posts to the API to register and log in users,
* uses JSON Web Tokens to fetch protected Chuck Norris quotes for authenticated users,
* stores tokens and user data with local storage,
* and logs users out by clearing tokens.

The full source code for the completed app can be [cloned at this GitHub repo](https://github.com/auth0-blog/polymer-with-jwt-api).

## Setup and Installation

We'll use the new [Polymer CLI](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli) to scaffold our Polymer web app with the [Polymer Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/polymer-starter-kit/). With the starter kit, we'll gain the advantages of routing, app layout, Material Design, and many core utilities right away. 

Let's get started!

### Dependencies

First, make sure that you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (with NPM) installed. 

If you don't already have [Bower](https://bower.io/), install it globally with the following command: 

```bash
npm install -g bower
```

Install the Polymer CLI: 

```bash
npm install -g polymer-cli
```

We also need to have a sample Node API running. Clone the [NodeJS JWT Authentication sample repo](https://github.com/auth0-blog/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample) and follow the instructions in the README to get it up and running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### Initializing a Polymer App

Create a new directory and navigate to it in the terminal or command prompt. Use the following command to initialize the Polymer starter kit in your new folder:

```bash
polymer init starter-kit
```

This command installs the starter kit app and necessary Bower components. Once the command completes, we can view the app in the browser by running:

```bash
polymer serve
```

The site runs at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Adding the optional `--open` flag will automatically launch that address in your default browser.

> Note: If you want to see the shadow DOM nodes in action in the inspector during development, [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is recommended. The app works in all modern browsers thanks to Polymer's inclusion of shady DOM and polyfills, but Chrome currently has the best native support for web components. 

When viewing your app in the browser, it looks like this:

![Polymer app starter kit browser view](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/screenshot_starterkit.jpg)

## Customizing the Polymer Starter Kit App

You can see that the starter kit app has several views. We want to customize it. When we've finished updating the structure and naming, our app should look like this:

![Polymer starter kit after renaming for Chuck Norris app](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/screenshot_routing.jpg)

Let's dig into the code to understand how Polymer applications and elements are composed and how we can modify it to suit our needs.

### Element Naming

Open the `/src` folder and take a look at its contents. These are the elements and views that make up the application. Notice that the file names are hyphenated (ie., `my-app`, `my-view1`). This follows the [W3C valid custom element naming spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/#valid-custom-element-name). 

> Custom element names must contain _at least one hyphen_.

The `my-app.html` file contains the main module that renders the other views based on the route (with [`app-route`](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/toolbox/routing) and [`iron-pages`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-pages)). The name `my-app` suits our purposes so we'll leave it as-is. The same goes for `my-icons` and `shared-styles`. However, `my-view1` is not descriptive enough. We'll rename these files and in doing so, learn about more Polymer elements.

### Renaming HTML Files

Our app will be composed of the following views:

1. A homepage that lets visitors click a button to display random Chuck Norris quotes.
2. A signup and login page with a form that lets visitors register or log into the app.
3. A secret quotes page where authenticated users can click a button to get protected Chuck Norris quotes.

We'll rename the generic starter kit views to match our planned view structure. The `/src` folder currently looks like this:

![Polymer starter kit src file structure](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/rename-files1.jpg)

Let's rename these files:

```bash
/src
  |-- my-view1.html
  |-- my-view2.html
  |-- my-view3.html
  |-- my-view404.html
```

to the following:

```bash
/src
  |-- home-quotes.html
  |-- register-login.html
  |-- secret-quotes.html
  |-- not-found.html
```

Our final file `/src` folder file structure should look like this:

![Polymer starter kit Chuck Norris app src file structure](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/rename-files2.jpg)

###Editing the Views

We've renamed the HTML files and now we need to rename the elements they contain. For _each_ of the updated views, open the file and do the following:

Locate the `<dom-module>` tag near the top of the file. This specifies the start of an [element's local DOM](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/local-dom#template-stamping). This is the [declarative](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/imperative-vs-declarative-programming-283e96bf8aea) portion of the element definition. Change its ID to match the new file name. 

For example: 

```html
<dom-module id="my-view1">
``` 

becomes: 

```html
<dom-module id="home-quotes">
```

Locate the `<script>` tag near the bottom of the file. The `Polymer()` function is the [imperative](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/imperative-vs-declarative-programming-283e96bf8aea) portion of the element definition. Change the `is` property to the new element name.

For example: 

```js
Polymer({ 
	is: 'my-view1',
	...
``` 

becomes: 

```js
Polymer({
	is: 'home-quotes',
	...
```

> Note: Read more about an element's [local DOM in the Polymer docs](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/local-dom).

### Modifying `my-app.html`

Our elements are renamed. Now we need to update references to them. The view elements are called in `/src/my-app.html`, so we'll make the necessary changes while familiarizing with the contents of the file.

Routing is handled by `<app-location>`, `<app-route>`, and `<iron-pages>`. Consult the documentation to learn more about [Polymer routing](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/toolbox/routing). 

To get our renamed views working with routing, locate the [`<app-drawer>`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-layout) element. This is the menu sidebar and currently contains links to the old routes, like so:

```html
<a name="view1" href="/view1">View One</a>
```

You may notice that the hyphenation (`my-`) is missing. It's being added programmatically and we'll need to remove it soon. First, change the anchor links inside the `<iron-selector>` element to match our renamed views for `home-quotes` and `secret-quotes`:

```html
...
<iron-selector selected="[[page]]" attr-for-selected="name" class="drawer-list" role="navigation">
	<a name="home-quotes" href="/home-quotes">Home</a>
	<a name="secret-quotes" href="/secret-quotes">Secret Quotes</a>
</iron-selector>
...
```

The "Log In" link would be best located in the header. Find the [header layout](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/toolbox/app-layout#header-layout) elements `<app-header>` and `<app-toolbar>`. Add the Log In link after the `<div main-title>My App</div>` element. While we're here, let's change the main title to "Chuck Norris" too. When we're done, the `<app-toolbar>` element should look like this:

```html
...
<app-toolbar>
	<paper-icon-button icon="menu" drawer-toggle></paper-icon-button>
	<div main-title>Chuck Norris</div>
	<a name="register-login" href="/register-login">Log In</a>
</app-toolbar>
...
```

Now we'll update the markup that places our view elements in the DOM. Locate the [`<iron-pages>`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-pages) tag. This element shows one of its children at a time and is used in conjunction with `<app-route>` to display views based on the URL. Update the elements inside this tag to reflect the renaming of our view elements:

```html
...
<iron-pages
	selected="[[page]]"
	attr-for-selected="name"
	fallback-selection="not-found"
	role="main">
	<home-quotes name="home-quotes"></home-quotes>
	<register-login name="register-login"></register-login>
	<secret-quotes name="secret-quotes"></secret-quotes>
	<not-found name="not-found"></not-found>
</iron-pages>
...
```

Now we'll make some changes in the Polymer function. This method takes an object prototype for a new element. You can read more about [defining elements](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/registering-elements) in the docs.

In the `<script>` tag, locate the `_routePageChanged()` function and change the default `this.page` to `home-quotes`:

```js
...
_routePageChanged: function(page) {
    this.page = page || 'home-quotes';
},
...
```

Next, find the `_pageChanged()` function. This is where the page URL is being prefixed with `my-`. Update the `resolvedPageUrl` variable:

```js
...
_pageChanged: function(page) {
    // Load page import on demand. Show 404 page if fails
    var resolvedPageUrl = this.resolveUrl(page + '.html');
    ...
```

Finally, update the `_showPage404()` function's `this.page` declaration to `not-found` to match our renamed element:

```js
...
_showPage404: function() {
    this.page = 'not-found';
}
...
```

### Update `polymer.json`

Open the `/polymer.json` file. This file contains the [build settings](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli#build) for our app when using the Polymer CLI. We'll update the `fragments` array with our renamed views. These are HTML files that are loaded on-demand or asynchronously.

```js
// polymer.json
...
"fragments": [
	"src/home-quotes.html",
	"src/register-login.html",
	"src/secret-quotes.html",
	"src/not-found.html"
  ],
...
```

Click between the routes to make sure everything works. We're now ready to start developing the features of our app.

## Building a Polymer Element

We'll start with the home view. When we're finished with this step, our app should look like this:  

![Polymer app element home quotes](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/screenshot_home-quotes.jpg)

Open the `/src/home-quotes.html` file. This is our `home-quotes` custom element. Right now it contains some lorem ipsum and lacks JS functionality beyond instantiation. We'll add an Ajax call to the [Chuck Norris API](https://github.com/auth0-blog/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample) and bindings to display the response on the page. We'll also add a button to get a new random quote when clicked.

### HTML Imports

The first thing we'll do is install some Polymer elements. We can leverage [`iron-ajax`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-ajax) to call the API and [`paper-button`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/paper-button) for the UI.

Install these components using Bower:

```bash
bower install PolymerElements/iron-ajax PolymerElements/paper-button --save
```

We need to import the elements into `home-quotes` using [HTML imports](http://webcomponents.org/articles/introduction-to-html-imports/). Since we're building web components, we want to import all the dependencies for a specific element in that element's HTML file. We don't want to rely on a parent element loading them first--that could create a missing dependency somwhere down the line. 

Doing this would be dangerous if we were loading scripts in the traditional way: we might get the same dependency called multiple times throughout the app. We would need to centralize file requests or use a dependency manager. However, with web components, we don't need to worry about loading the same imports multiple times because HTML imports dedupe: if an HTML import has already been loaded, it skips loading it again.

The Polymer library and `shared-styles` element are already being imported in our `home-quotes` element. We'll add the two elements we just installed with Bower:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- home-quotes.html -->
...
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/iron-ajax/iron-ajax.html">
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/paper-button/paper-button.html">
{% endhighlight html %}

Now we can take advantage of these elements.

### Calling an API with iron-ajax

> Make sure you have the [Chuck Norris Node API](https://github.com/auth0-blog/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample) cloned and running so that the API is accessible on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

We're going to call the API using HTML. The only JavaScript we need to write in this element will be a simple handler to re-send the Ajax request when a button is clicked. Pretty cool, huh?

After the closing `</style>` tag (we'll come back to styling shortly), add the following `iron-ajax` element:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<iron-ajax
	id="getQuoteAjax"
	auto 
	url="http://localhost:3001/api/random-quote"
	method="get"
	handle-as="text"
	last-response="{{quote}}"></iron-ajax>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

> Note: It's always worthwhile to take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-ajax) for any custom elements you're using, including [Polymer elements](https://github.com/PolymerElements).

We gave `iron-ajax` a descriptive `id` so we can access its instance in JS using `this.$.getQuoteAjax`. Setting the `auto` attribute re-sends the request anytime the URL or parameters change. For our purposes, this fetches a quote when the element first loads. Since we won't change the URL or parameters again after initialization, we'll generate subsequent requests with a button click handler. We're using the `GET` method. The API returns the response as a string, so we'll set `handle-as="text"` (other options include `xml`, `json`, `blob`, etc.). 

Finally, `last-response` can bind the response from the most recent request. We're [automatic / two-way data binding](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/data-binding#two-way-bindings) it to a property called `quote` with [double curly braces](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/data-binding#binding-annotation) as delimiters. `iron-ajax` is bundled with a dependency element called [`iron-request`](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-ajax/blob/master/iron-request.html) which performs the Ajax request. The response needs to be two-way bound to communicate up and down between the request and our instance of the `iron-ajax` element. You can read more about [data flow in Polymer here](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/data-system#data-flow).

### Binding and Fetching Quotes

We now have the response from the API. We need to display the quote in the view. Locate the card div `<div class="card">` and delete the lipsum contents.

Add a heading and a `<blockquote>`. Inside the blockquote element, one-way bind the `quote` API response using [double square bracket delimiters](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/data-binding#binding-annotation) (`[[quote]]`). We're using one-way binding here because data is flowing downward from host to target but not upwards. In order to get new quotes, let's add a button below the blockquote.

{% highlight html %}
<div class="card">
	<h1>Quotes</h1>
	<blockquote>[[quote]]</blockquote>
	<paper-button raised on-tap="getQuote" class="primary">Get a New Quote</paper-button>
</div>
{% endhighlight html %}

Check out the [paper-button documentation](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/paper-button) to read about button styling and API. We've added an [`on-tap`](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/events#annotated-listeners) [event listener](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/events) so when we click or tap the button, we can request another quote from the API by executing a function.

In our JS, let's add the `getQuote()` function and generate another Ajax request. We'll use the `iron-ajax` method [`generateRequest()`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-ajax#method-generateRequest) to do this. Remember, we can reference this instance by its ID:

```js
Polymer({
	...
	getQuote: function() {
		// get a quote from the API
		this.$.getQuoteAjax.generateRequest();
	}
});
```

We should now be able to click the "Get a New Quote" button in our app to get and display random Chuck Norris quotes.

### Styling

Web component elements use [shadow DOM styling rules](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/shadowdom/#styling). Styles defined in the shadow root are local. This means we can target IDs and classes within our custom element without contaminating the rest of the page or application. 

The quote and button look a bit shabby so let's spruce them up with CSS. Head back up to the top of the `/src/home-quotes.html` file and find the `<style>` tag. Notice that this tag `include`s the `shared-styles` element. Since we'll be using the `blockquote` and `paper-button` styles elsewhere in the app for the `secret-quotes` element too, we'll want to put our styles somewhere they can be accessed globally.

Open `/src/shared-styles.html`. We can add our common styles here as well as clean up some CSS we won't be using anymore.

Delete the `.circle` ruleset and add the following:

```css
/* shared-styles.html */
...
:root {
	--primary-color: #4285f4;
}
a,
paper-button {
	font-weight: bold;
}
a {
	color: var(--primary-color);
}
paper-button {
	color: #fff;
}
paper-button.primary {
	background: var(--primary-color);
}
blockquote {
	border-left: 4px solid #eee;
	margin-left: 4px;
	padding-left: 20px;
}
...
```

As you can see, we can use [custom CSS properties](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/styling#custom-css-properties) with Polymer:

```css
:root {
	--primary-color: #4285f4;
}
...
a {
	color: var(--primary-color);
}
...
paper-button.primary {
	background: var(--primary-color);
}
```

Many of [Polymer's Material Design Paper elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=paper-elements) can be customized by setting variables. We can also create our own. We'll set the primary color on the `:root` selector so that it [applies to all custom elements](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/styling#custom-style). We'll then use the variable to style our `paper-button` element with a `.primary` class.

> Note: By setting the `--primary-color` variable now, the focus color for inputs will also be preset when we use [`paper-input-container`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/paper-input?active=paper-input-container#styling) later.

Now the `.primary` class that we added to our button will be styled in the `home-quotes` element.

## Authenticating Users in a Polymer App

Users should be able to register so they can log in and access secret quotes. We'll create a form for visitors to enter credentials and `POST` data to the API to sign up or log in and receive a [JWT access token](http://jwt.io). We also need to handle sign up and login errors as well as save to local storage to persist logins. 

When this step is complete, our login view will look like this:

![Polymer register login app view](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/screenshot_login.jpg)

### Creating the User Credentials Form

Open `/src/register-login.html`. This is our `register-login` element. We'll use some more Polymer elements from the catalog, so let's start by installing [`iron-input`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-input) and [`paper-input`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/paper-input):

```bash
bower install PolymerElements/iron-input PolymerElements/paper-input --save
```

Now we'll import these new dependencies along with `iron-ajax`, `paper-button`, and `iron-localstorage`. We don't need to install `iron-localstorage` with Bower because it came packaged with the starter kit.

> Note: You can check your `/bower_components` directory to see what other Polymer components are automatically installed.

The HTML imports for `register-login` should now look like this:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- register-login.html -->

<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/iron-ajax/iron-ajax.html">
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/iron-localstorage/iron-localstorage.html">
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/iron-input/iron-input.html">
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/paper-input/paper-input.html">
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/paper-button/paper-button.html">
<link rel="import" href="shared-styles.html">
{% endhighlight html %}

First we'll set up the basic markup for the form with a username and password. Logging in and signing up require the same fields so we'll use the same form for both. 

> Note: A potential future enhancement might be to split register and login into separate views and add a Confirm Password field when signing up.

Delete the lorem ipsum inside the `<div class="card">` element. We want to create two potential UIs for this area: one for if the user is authenticated and one for if they aren't. We'll start with the unauthenticated view, which is the register / login form.

Create a container for the unauthenticated UI and add input elements using [`iron-input`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-input) and [`paper-input-container`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/paper-input?active=paper-input-container), which comes bundled with `paper-input`. The reason we aren't using `paper-input` by itself is because `iron-input` allows us to two-way bind input values. It also provides validation options. We won't do validation in this tutorial, but using this element provides more room for extensibility. Using `paper-input-container` applies Material Design styles to labels and inputs. This way we can utilize both the iron element utilities _and_ the paper element styles.

Our initial markup should look like this:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="card">
	<div id="unauthenticated">
		<h1>Log In</h1>

		<p><strong>Log in</strong> or <strong>sign up</strong> to access secret Chuck Norris quotes!</p>
		
		<paper-input-container>
			<label>Username</label>
			<input is="iron-input" id="username" type="text" bind-value="{{formData.username}}">
		</paper-input-container>

		<paper-input-container>
			<label>Password</label>
			<input is="iron-input" id="password" type="password" bind-value="{{formData.password}}">
		</paper-input-container>

		<div class="wrapper-btns">
			<paper-button raised class="primary" on-tap="postLogin">Log In</paper-button>
			<paper-button class="link" on-tap="postRegister">Sign Up</paper-button>
		</div>
	</div>	
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight html %}

We'll also add some local CSS in the `<style>` tags:

```css
...
.wrapper-btns {
	margin-top: 15px;
}
paper-button.link {
	color: #757575;
}
```

Now we have a form, but it doesn't do anything. We'll wire it up with JS to take advantage of `iron-input` and bind the values to data that we can submit to the API. Create a property that holds an object for our form data:

```js
Polymer({
	is: 'register-login',
	properties: {
		formData: {
			type: Object,
			value: {}
		}
	}
	...
```

[Polymer properties](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/properties) are members of the element's public API and can be declared on the prototype. We'll set the default value of `formData` to an empty object so we can add properties to it simply by typing in the input fields.

> Note: Why weren't we required to declare `quote` as a property in the `home-quotes` element? The fetched `quote` is not a member of the element's public API _and_ did not need a default value or options. The `quote` property could be added as type `String` to `home-quotes` to no ill effect, but it was left off to demonstrate that Polymer will bind without it and there is no need to expose it to the element's API: we won't set the quote as an attribute when calling the `<home-quotes>` element.

We already bound the `formData` object to the inputs in the HTML using `bind-value` attributes. This allows the data to flow between the markup (declarative API) and the JS (imperative API).

### Submitting the Form with Ajax

We'll use `iron-ajax` again to post our form data to the API to register or log in users:

```html
<iron-ajax
	id="registerLoginAjax"
	method="post"
	content-type="application/json"
	handle-as="text"
	on-response="handleUserResponse"
	on-error="handleUserError"></iron-ajax>
```

We'll use the `POST` method and set the content type to JSON. We're going to handle the response as text because although a successful login returns JSON, a failure returns a string. This way we can easily parse the JSON on success or handle plain text in case of an error.

There is no `url` attribute on our `iron-ajax` element this time. We'll set the URL based on whether the user clicks "Log In" or "Sign Up". We've already added `on-tap` attributes to the two buttons to attach handlers.

Now we'll add the corresponding `postLogin()` and `postRegister()` event handlers to the JS. We also need to set the request body containing the form data when the user clicks a button to submit. Then we'll generate the Ajax request. Add the following to the `Polymer()` function in the JS:

```js
...
_setReqBody: function() {
	this.$.registerLoginAjax.body = this.formData;
},
postLogin: function() {
	this.$.registerLoginAjax.url = 'http://localhost:3001/sessions/create';
	this._setReqBody();
	this.$.registerLoginAjax.generateRequest();
},
postRegister: function() {
	this.$.registerLoginAjax.url = 'http://localhost:3001/users';
	this._setReqBody();
	this.$.registerLoginAjax.generateRequest();
}
...
```

### Handling API Responses

We're successfully `POST`ing to the API. Next we need to handle the API response. At this time, we have listener methods defined in the markup but not in the JS:

```html
<iron-ajax
	...
	on-response="handleUserResponse"
	on-error="handleUserError"></iron-ajax>
```

Let's add `handleUserResponse()` and `handleUserError()`:

```js
properties: {
	...
	storedUser: Object,
	error: String
},
...
handleUserResponse: function(event) {
	var response = JSON.parse(event.detail.response);

	if (response.id_token) {
		this.error = '';
		this.storedUser = {
			name: this.formData.username,
			id_token: response.id_token,
			access_token: response.access_token,
			loggedin: true
		};
	}

	// reset form data
	this.formData = {};
},
handleUserError: function(event) {
	this.error = event.detail.request.xhr.response;
}
```

We're adding two more properties: `storedUser` (an object to store name, id token, access token, and state of an authenticated user), and `error` (a string to display when the API returns a failure). Later we'll add `storedUser` to local storage and access it in other areas of the app. We can use shorthand `property: [Type]` because we don't need any additional options set.

Next we'll handle a successful API response: `handleUserResponse()`. Recall that we're handling all responses as text, so we need to parse the JSON. If a token is present we'll clear any errors from previous failures, define the `storedUser` object and its properties, and reset `formData` to an empty object.

We've also defined a handler for errors: `handleUserError()`. When the sample API fails, it returns an error message as a string. We'll set the `error` property to this XHR response. You can `console.log()` the `event` parameter in these two handlers to become more familiar with its structure.

Now we have the error message but we're not displaying it to the user. We'd like to show something like this:

![Polymer register login with error](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/screenshot_login-error.jpg)

Let's add some markup after the instructions paragraph to support this:

```html
...
<template is="dom-if" if="[[error]]">
	<p class="alert-error"><strong>Error:</strong> [[error]]</p>
</template>
...
```

Templates with `is="dom-if"` are [conditionally stamped](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/templates#dom-if) when their `if` property is truthy. 

We can now see an error message if we try to submit empty or invalid credentials to the API. Let's add some styling to make error messages more prominent. Add the following ruleset to the `register-login` element's local `<style>` tag:

```css
...
.alert-error {
	background: #ffcdd2;
	border: 1px solid #f44336;
	border-radius: 3px;
	color: #333;
	font-size: 14px;
	padding: 10px;
}
```

### Saving Data to Local Storage

To persist user sessions, add the [`iron-localstorage`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-localstorage) element near the top of our element markup:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<iron-localstorage name="user-storage" value="{{storedUser}}"></iron-localstorage>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Now users don't have to log in repeatedly after refresh or return visit.

### Showing UI Based on Authentication State

We're now authenticating, but there's no indication to the user that they're logged in. We'll hide the form and show a message upon successful authentication.

Add a `hidden` attribute to the `#authenticated` div:

{% highlight html %}
<div id="unauthenticated" hidden$="[[storedUser.loggedin]]">
{% endhighlight html %}

We want `hidden` to have a binding and be conditionally applied. If we don't do this, its presence implies truthiness regardless of its value. To [bind to an attribute](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/data-binding#attribute-binding), we need to add a dollar sign `$` after the attribute name.

We'll show the user a logged-in UI if they're authenticated. Add another div:

{% highlight html %}
...
<div id="authenticated" hidden$="[[!storedUser.loggedin]]">
	<h2>Hello, [[storedUser.name]]!</h2>
	<p>You are currently logged in. You can access <a href="/secret-quotes">Secret Quotes</a>!</p>
</div>
{% endhighlight html %}

Now when the user logs in, they won't see the form anymore and will see this greeting instead. However, we can take this one step further and redirect them to the Secret Quotes view on successful authentication.

### Redirecting After Authentication

To redirect the user to another view with Polymer app routing in place, we need to include the [`app-location`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-route?active=app-location) element. This synchronizes browser location and application state and gives us access to a `route` object. 

Add `app-location` to the imports at the top of the file. It's already installed because it came bundled with the starter kit (we've seen it in `/src/my-app.html`):

```html
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/app-route/app-location.html">
```

Now add the element:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<app-location route="{{route}}"></app-location>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In our `handleUserResponse()` function, we can now set the `route.path` to the path we want to redirect to:

```js
handleUserResponse: function(event) {
	...
	if (response.id_token) {
		...
		// redirect to Secret Quotes
		this.set('route.path', '/secret-quotes');
	}
	...
},
```

> Note: Using `this.set('property.subproperty', ...)` instead of `this.property.subproperty =` ensures that [we're making observable changes](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/data-system#make-observable-changes) to object subproperties.

### Making User Data Available Globally

What if we want to access and manipulate user authentication state from other areas of the app? For instance, the header still says "Log In" when the user is authenticated. We should change this to a greeting and a "Log Out" button. We can also see "Secret Quotes" in the menu while logged out. This should be hidden from unauthenticated users. But most importantly, we need to use the authenticated user's token to access the protected API to get secret quotes.

Recall that `iron-localstorage` has a binding to `storedUser` which is a property of the `register-login` element. Even though local storage is accessible globally, we don't have a _simple_ way to be sure that changes are observed on all parents and children throughout the app.

Polymer 1.0 does not have an elegant, out-of-the-box solution to this problem at this time. This is something any full-featured JS framework would make short work of, but it's important to remember that Polymer is _not_ a framework: it's a library that helps us leverage web components.

To solve this, we're going to add an element called `app-data`. This element notifies instances when its data is changed.

Create a file in `/src` called `app-data.html`. Add the following code:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- app-data.html -->

<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">

<dom-module id="app-data">
	<script>
		(function() {
			var instances = [];
			var vars = Object.create(Polymer.Base);

			Polymer({
				is: 'app-data',
				
				properties: {
					data: {
						type: Object,
						value: '',
						notify: true,
						readonly: false,
						observer: '_data_changed'
					},
					key: String
				},

				created: function() {
					key = this.getAttribute('key');
					if (!key) {
						console.log(this);
						throw('app-data element requires key');
					}
					instances.push({key:key, instance:this});
				},

				detached: function() {
					key = this.getAttribute('key');
					var i = instances.indexOf({key:key, instance:this});
					if (i >= 0) {
						instances.splice(i, 1);
					}
				},

				_data_changed: function(newvalue, oldvalue) {
					key = this.getAttribute('key');
					if (!key) {
						throw('_data_changed: app-data element requires key');
					}
					vars.set(key, newvalue);

					// notify the instances with the correct key
					for (var i = 0; i < instances.length; i++) {
						if (instances[i].key == key) {
							instances[i].instance.notifyPath('data', newvalue);
						}
					}
				}
			});
		}());
	</script>
</dom-module>
{% endhighlight html %}

> Note: To learn more about `app-data` and its origins, check out this [Stack Overflow question about global variables in Polymer 1.0](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30849816/polymer-1-0-global-variables) and specifically, [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/31771240).

In `/src/register-login.html`, import the new `app-data` dependency:

```html
<link rel="import" href="app-data.html">
```

Add the `app-data` element to the markup. We need to supply an identifying `key` and the `data` we want is, of course, the `storedUser` object.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<app-data key="userData" data="{{storedUser}}"></app-data>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

We can now add the `app-data` element to any other components that need access to this global data. All instances will be notified when the data is changed.

## Creating a Log Out Element

Now that we can register and authenticate users, we need a way for them to log out. This should be a component that can live in a couple of locations, so we're going to build a new element.

Create a new file: `/src/log-out.html`. Import Polymer, `paper-button`, and `app-data`:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- log-out.html -->

<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/paper-button/paper-button.html">
<link rel="import" href="app-data.html">
{% endhighlight html %}

Now we'll scaffold our new element by adding `<dom-module id="log-out">`. We'll set up the `<template>`, `<style>`, and `<script>` tags as well. The `:host` styles should have no margin or padding.

```html
<dom-module id="log-out">
	<template>
		<style>
			:host {
				margin: 0;
				padding: 0;
			}
		</style>
		
		<!-- MARKUP GOES HERE -->
	</template>

	<script>
		(function() {
			Polymer({
				is: 'log-out'
			});
		}());
	</script>
</dom-module>
```

Here are our plans for the `log-out` element:

* Display a log out link in the app's global header when the user is authenticated.
* Display a log out button in the authenticated `register-login` view.
* When the link or button is clicked, clear the user's token and information from global app data.
* Call the element, pass in the `storedUser`, and be able to add an optional `link` attribute to display an anchor tag instead of a button.

Keeping these requirements in mind, let's build out our element, starting with the markup:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<app-data key="userData" data="{{storedUser}}"></app-data>

<template is="dom-if" if="{{!link}}">
	<paper-button raised on-tap="logout">Log Out</paper-button>
</template>

<template is="dom-if" if="{{link}}">
	<a on-tap="logout" href>Log Out</a>
</template>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This should look familiar. We're accessing `app-data` so when we log out, changes to the data are set throughout the app. We'll check for a `link` property and if it's false, show a button. If it's true, show a link. Both the link and button will call the same `on-tap` handler, `logout()`.

> Note: You may have noticed that we didn't include `iron-localstorage`. Changes to `storedUser` in `log-out` use `app-data` to notify other instances which update `iron-localstorage`. In turn, local storage is retrieved by the parent upon app initialization and the property is then sent to the child `log-out` via its `stored-user` attribute.

Here's the JS to facilitate our required `log-out` behavior:

```js
Polymer({
	is: 'log-out',
	properties: {
		storedUser: Object,
		link: {
			type: Boolean,
			value: false
		}
	},
	logout: function() {
		// remove user data
		this.storedUser = null;
	}
});
```

The `storedUser` object will be passed into the element from the parent but we'll need to manipulate it to perform logout. The `link` property will be true if it's present as an attribute on the `<log-out>` element. The default value of a boolean property must be set to false in order for it to [function as an attribute](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/properties#configuring-boolean-properties) that can be configured by markup.

To log out, all we need to do is set the `storedUser` object to `null`.

Now let's finish up by adding some styles: 

```css
:host {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
}
paper-button {
	background: #f44336;
	color: #fff;
	font-weight: bold;
}
a {
	color: #fff;
	display: inline-block;
	font-size: 13px;
}
```

The link will display in the blue header area so the text should be white. If we need to add additional links in other contexts, we can always adjust the styling to add variables or other options.

Now that we have our `log-out` element, let's add it to the `/src/register-login.html` view:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<!-- register-login.html -->

<div id="authenticated" hidden$="[[!storedUser.loggedin]]">
	...
	<log-out stored-user="{{storedUser}}"></log-out>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight html %}

Our authenticated `register-login` now looks like this in the browser:

![Polymer login view when authenticated show log out button](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/screenshot_logout.jpg)

Recall that after login, users are redirected to the `secret-quotes` view. We'll replace the "Log In" link in the header shortly. However, the `/register-login` route will be accessible regardless of authentication state: the user can access it via the URL or the browser Back button. If they visit this route while logged in, they'll see this message and be able to log out.

## Fetching Secret Quotes

It's time to access the protected API to get secret quotes. When we're finished with this step, our app will look like this:

![Polymer secret quotes view when logged in](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/screenshot_secret-quotes.jpg)

Open `/src/secret-quotes.html` and add the following dependencies: `iron-ajax`, `iron-localstorage`, `paper-button`, and `app-data`. Clean up the contents of the `<div class="card">` element:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- secret-quotes.html -->

<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/iron-ajax/iron-ajax.html">
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/iron-localstorage/iron-localstorage.html">
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/paper-button/paper-button.html">
<link rel="import" href="app-data.html">
<link rel="import" href="shared-styles.html">
...
<div class="card">
	<h1>Secret Quotes</h1>
</div>
...
{% endhighlight html %}

Add the `iron-localstorage` and `app-data` elements:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<iron-localstorage 
	name="user-storage" 
	value="{{storedUser}}" 
	on-iron-localstorage-load="initStoredUser"></iron-localstorage>

<app-data key="userData" data="{{storedUser}}"></app-data>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

We'll use the `on-iron-localstorage-load` event to get a quote automatically if an authenticated user enters the app on this page.

Next add `iron-ajax`:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<iron-ajax 
	id="getSecretQuoteAjax"
	method="get"
	url="http://localhost:3001/api/protected/random-quote"
	handle-as="text"
	last-response="{{secretQuote}}"></iron-ajax>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This looks similar to the `iron-ajax` element we used to get public quotes in the `home-quotes` element except that we're not using the `auto` attribute. We'll add authorization to this request in the JS when we generate the request.

We'll display the quotes in the UI. We want to show authenticated users a greeting and private quotes. If an unauthenticated user visits this route, we should show a message instructing them to log in:

![Polymer unauthenticated view of secret quotes](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/screenshot_secret-quotes_unauth.jpg)

Add the following markup:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="card">
	<h1>Secret Quotes</h1>

	<div hidden$="[[!storedUser.loggedin]]">
		<p>Hello, [[storedUser.name]]! You have access to secret quotes:</p>
		<blockquote>[[secretQuote]]</blockquote>
		<paper-button class="primary" raised on-tap="getSecretQuote">Get a New Secret Quote</paper-button>
	</div>

	<p hidden$="[[storedUser.loggedin]]">You must <a href="/register-login">log in</a> to access secret quotes!</p>
</div>
{% endhighlight html %}

We can use `hidden` because although the authenticated content is stamped in the template on initiation, unauthenticated users cannot access the protected quotes API.

> Note: Using `hidden` is much faster than creating and destroying elements with `dom-if`, which can cause noticeable runtime latency. You can read more about this in the [dom-if Polymer docs](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/templates#dom-if).

In JS, add the `storedUser` property, `initStoredUser()`, and `getSecretQuote()`:

```js
Polymer({
	is: 'secret-quotes',
	properties: {
		storedUser: Object
	},
	initStoredUser: function() {
		// if entering site on the secret quotes page, verify if logged in and if so, preload a secret quote
		if (this.storedUser.loggedin) {
			this.getSecretQuote();
		}
	},
	getSecretQuote: function() {
		// add token authorization and generate Ajax request
		this.$.getSecretQuoteAjax.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer ' + this.storedUser.access_token;
		this.$.getSecretQuoteAjax.generateRequest();
	}
});
```

`getSecretQuote()` is executed when the user clicks the button to fetch a new quote from the API. We'll use the `generateRequest()` method and provide an `Authorization` header with the user's access token.

Authenticated users can now get secret quotes!

## Header and Menu States

The last thing we'll do is improve the user experience. When the user is logged in, let's hide the Secret Quotes link and add a greeting and log out link in the header. 

Open `/src/my-app.html`. Import `iron-localstorage`, `app-data`, and `log-out` dependencies and add the `<iron-localstorage>` and `<app-data>` elements to the DOM:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<!-- my-app.html -->
...
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/iron-localstorage/iron-localstorage.html">
<link rel="import" href="app-data.html">
<link rel="import" href="log-out.html">
...
<iron-localstorage name="user-storage" value="{{storedUser}}"></iron-localstorage>
<app-data key="userData" data="{{storedUser}}"></app-data>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Hiding "Secret Quotes" in the Menu

Locate the `<iron-selector>` element inside the `<app-drawer>`. Each `<a>` tag  needs to be wrapped in its own container element in order to be hidden and shown conditionally. You can read more about [iron-selector here](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-selector).

Change the code to:

{% highlight html %}
...
<div name="home-quotes">
	<a href="/home-quotes">Home</a>
</div>
<div name="secret-quotes" hidden$="[[!storedUser.loggedin]]">
	<a href="/secret-quotes">Secret Quotes</a>
</div>
...
{% endhighlight html %}

As you can see, we've moved the `name` attributes to the containing divs and added a `hidden` attribute to the Secret Quotes link.

### Authentication State in the Header

We want our logged in user to see something like this in the app header:

![Polymer authenticated user state in header](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/screenshot_quotes-header-auth.jpg)

Let's update the `<app-header>` to show the "Log In" link when the user is logged out and a greeting with the `log-out` element when authenticated.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
...
<app-header condenses reveals effects="waterfall">
	<app-toolbar>
		...
		<a name="register-login" href="/register-login" hidden$="[[storedUser.loggedin]]">Log In</a>
		<div hidden$="[[!storedUser.loggedin]]">
			<span class="greeting">Hi [[storedUser.name]]!</span>
			<log-out stored-user="{{storedUser}}" link></log-out>
		</div>
	</app-toolbar>
</app-header>
...
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight html %}

Add the `storedUser` object to the Polymer properties in the JS:

```js
Polymer({
	is: 'my-app',
	properties: {
		...,
		storedUser: Object
	},
	...
```

Finally, we'll add some CSS in the `<style>` block:

```css
...
app-header .greeting,
app-header a {
	color: #fff;
	font-size: 13px;
}
app-header .greeting {
	border-right: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.5);
	display: inline-block;
	padding-right: 6px;
}
```

We now have a functioning user state in the global header. When we log in or out, no matter what view we're on, the header and menu will update according to authentication status.

## Aside: Authenticating a Polymer App with Auth0

Let's explore authenticating the client side of a Polymer app with a more robust solution. We'll do a quick implementation of [Auth0's Lock widget](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock) to manage user identity. We'll leverage local storage and `app-data` again to ensure users aren't logged out unexpectedly. You can clone the full code from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/auth0-blog/polymer-with-auth0).

![Polymer register login app view with Auth0 Lock](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/auth0-lock.jpg)

When users are logged in, they'll see something like this:

![Polymer logged in with Auth0](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/polymer/auth0-loggedin.jpg)

### Configuring Your Auth0 Client

The first thing you'll need is an Auth0 account. Follow these simple steps to get started:

1. Sign up for a [free Auth0 account](javascript:signup\(\)).
2. In your **Auth0 Dashboard**, [create a new client](https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients/create). 
3. Name your new app and select "Single Page Web Applications". 
4. In the **Settings** for your newly created app, add `http://localhost:8080` to the Allowed Callback URLs and Allowed Logout URLs.
5. If you'd like, you can [set up some social connections](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/social). You can then enable them for your app in the **Client** options under the **Connections** tab. The example shown in the screenshot above uses username/password database, Facebook, and Google.

### Setup and Dependencies

Create a new directory, `init` a fresh Polymer starter kit app, then `serve` it:

```bash
polymer init starter-kit
polymer serve --open
```

Create a new file in the `/src` folder for `app-data.html`. Follow the instructions from earlier in this tutorial to populate this element file, or [grab the code from the repo here](https://github.com/auth0-blog/polymer-with-auth0/blob/master/src/app-data.html).

### Creating the Auth0 Lock Element

Create a new file: `/src/auth0-login.html`. This will be our `auth0-login` custom element.

> **Important note:** We should _not_ name this element `auth0-lock` because doing so will cause style conflicts in browsers that don't fully support shadow DOM. Instead of encapsulating with shadow DOM, a CSS class matching the element name is applied to all child nodes. The Auth0 Lock widget itself has a class called `.auth0-lock`, so this causes styling conflicts. We'll name the custom element `auth0-login` to ensure uniqueness.

Our `auth0-login` element will include the following: 

* An element containing [lock.js v10](https://cdn.auth0.com/js/lock/10.2/lock.min.js).
* A link with an event handler to open the Lock widget.
* Properties to pass Auth0 configuration into the element.
* A greeting with profile image and logout button to show when the user is authenticated.

> **Important security note:** In this demo, we're adding authentication to the client side but we are not securing a backend. If you have an API for your application, the API should _always_ be secured. The [`id_token` should not be used to secure an API](https://auth0.com/blog/why-should-use-accesstokens-to-secure-an-api); instead use an `access_token` with the appropriate configuration. You can read about how to [implement API authentication with Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/apis) with [implicit grant](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/implicit-grant).

Let's create the dependency element: `/src/lockjs.html`. Create a new file and add the following:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- lockjs.html -->
<script src="https://cdn.auth0.com/js/lock/10.2/lock.min.js"></script>
{% endhighlight html %}

This is best practice in Polymer for loading third party dependencies. This way, we can use HTML import to load this file and be certain that it will only be imported once. If it's called again, it will be deduped.

Now we can build `/src/auth0-login.html`:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<!-- auth0-login.html -->

<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/iron-localstorage/iron-localstorage.html">
<link rel="import" href="app-data.html">
<link rel="import" href="lockjs.html">

<dom-module id="auth0-login">
	<template>
		<style>
			:host {
				color: #fff;
				font-size: 13px;
			}
			.greeting {
				border-right: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.5);
				display: inline-block;
				padding-right: 6px;
			}
			.greeting img {
				border-radius: 100px;
				display: inline-block;
				height: 24px;
				margin-right: 4px;
				vertical-align: middle;
				width: 24px;
			}
			a {
				color: #fff;
			}
		</style>

		<iron-localstorage 
			name="userData" 
			value="{{storedUser}}" 
			on-iron-localstorage-load="_setProfileImg"></iron-localstorage>
		<app-data key="userData" data="{{storedUser}}"></app-data>

		<a hidden$="[[storedUser.loggedin]]" on-tap="showLock" href>Log In</a>

		<div hidden$="[[!storedUser.loggedin]]">
			<span class="greeting"><img src="[[profileImgSrc]]">[[storedUser.profile.nickname]]</span>
			<a on-tap="logOut" href>Log Out</a>
		</div>
	</template>

	<script>
		(function() {
			Polymer({
				is: 'auth0-login',
				properties: {
					clientId: String,
					domain: String,
					redirectUrl: String,
					storedUser: Object,
					auth0Lock: Object,
					profileImgSrc: {
						type: String,
						value: ''
					}
				},
				ready: function() {
					var _self = this;
					var _lockOptions = {
						auth: {
							redirectUrl: _self.redirectUrl,
							responseType: 'token'
						}
					};

					// create Auth0 Lock instance
					_self.auth0Lock = new Auth0Lock(_self.clientId, _self.domain, _lockOptions);

					_self.auth0Lock.on('authenticated', function(authResult) {
						// save token
						_self.set('storedUser', { token: authResult.idToken });

						// get user's profile using token
						_self.auth0Lock.getProfile(authResult.idToken, function(error, profile) {
							if (error) {
								console.error('Error getting profile:', error);
								return;
							}

							_self.set('storedUser.loggedin', true);
							_self.set('storedUser.profile', profile);
							_self.set('profileImgSrc', profile.picture);
						});
					});
				},
				_setProfileImg: function() {
					this.set('profileImgSrc', this.storedUser.profile.picture);
				},
				showLock: function() {
					this.auth0Lock.show();
				},
				logOut: function() {
					this.set('storedUser', null);
					this.set('profileImgSrc', '');
				}
			});
		}());
	</script>
</dom-module>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight html %}

You can read all about `lock.js` in the [Auth0 Lock library docs](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock). 

> Note: We're setting the profile image with JS rather than binding directly to `storedUser.profile.picture` because if we don't, the image `src` will populate as `undefined` and result in a 404 network error when not set.

We now have a Lock element that can be launched by clicking a "Log In" link. We need to place it in our app and pass in the appropriate Auth0 configuration.

### Adding Auth0 Lock to a Polymer App

Open `/src/my-app.html` and import the `iron-localstorage`, `app-data`, and `auth0-login` dependencies. Add the `<iron-localstorage>` and `<app-data>` elements to the DOM and add the `storedUser` object to the Polymer properties in the JS.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<!-- my-app.html -->
...
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/iron-localstorage/iron-localstorage.html">
<link rel="import" href="app-data.html">
<link rel="import" href="auth0-login.html">
...
<iron-localstorage name="userData" value="{{storedUser}}"></iron-localstorage>
<app-data key="userData" data="{{storedUser}}"></app-data>
...
Polymer({
  is: 'my-app',
  properties: {
	storedUser: Object,
	...
  },
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight html %}

Now we'll add our `<auth0-login>` element to the DOM. We want to display the "Log In" link / user greeting in the header, just like we did in the Chuck Norris app.

```html
...
<app-header condenses reveals effects="waterfall">
  <app-toolbar>
    <paper-icon-button icon="menu" drawer-toggle></paper-icon-button>
    <div main-title>My App</div>
    
    <auth0-login 
		client-id="[YOUR_CLIENT_ID]" 
		domain="[YOUR_DOMAIN].auth0.com" 
		redirect-url="http://localhost:8080"></auth0-login>
		
  </app-toolbar>
</app-header>
...
```

To get your `client ID` and `domain`, find your app in the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients) and look in **Settings**.

Now users can sign up for an account, log in, and log out. You can utilize the techniques we learned earlier to access protected API routes, show and hide UI, set up redirection, and more. Check out the [Auth0 Docs](https://auth0.com/docs) to read about features, APIs, guides, and more.

## The Future of Web (Components)

The beauty of web components is that they're composed of native DOM features: they're literally the future of the web. Web developers have a long history of struggling with DOM encapsulation and CSS scoping--and subsequently [inventing](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/) [paradigms](http://getbem.com/introduction/) [to compensate](https://smacss.com/). Web components offer solutions.

Remember that Polymer itself is _not a framework_. It's a library to facilitate easy, compatible web component usage. When you use Polymer, your framework is the DOM. It's also important to know that [JS frameworks like Angular 2 are currently leveraging web component concepts](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2015/06/29/shadow-dom-strategies-in-angular2.html). 

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="When you use Polymer, your framework is the DOM." %}

Web components may be the future, but there's no reason not to get started with them today. Google uses Polymer in many of its sites, [GitHub uses web components](http://webcomponents.org/articles/interview-with-joshua-peek/), and [there are](https://youtu.be/fD2As5RmM8Q?t=15m56s) [many others](https://builtwithpolymer.org/) leveraging these technologies. Custom elements are being built and shared with the community every day. In addition to Google's [Polymer Element Catalog](https://elements.polymer-project.org/), developers can share web components on [customelements.io](http://customelements.io) and take advantage of [element libraries like Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/elements).

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="Learning Polymer isn't like tackling a massive JS framework: it's a veneer over native features." %}

**Polymer** delivers a way to use web components cross-browser while learning the native spec at the same time. Learning Polymer isn't like tackling a massive JS framework: it's a veneer over native features. You can build something simple or complex with web components. Polymer is intuitive to learn and the experience with web components will be invaluable for many projects, frameworks, and libraries to come.
