**TL;DR**

[Koa](http://koajs.com/) is a web framework for Node.JS that is based on [async functions, a new ES7 feature](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/es7-async-functions/), providing a simpler and more concise API. In this article, we will build a grocery list application, with an [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) front-end, that communicates with a Koa based backend. Our application will take advantage of [JWT tokens](https://jwt.io/) to secure these communications. The full implementation is [provided on this repo at GitHub](https://github.com/auth0-blog/grocery-list/tree/jwt).

## Overview

For our application, we will use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a programming language that extends JavaScript with type checking, for developing both our backend and frontend. Angular 2 already advises us to use TypeScript when writing applications with their framework. But, besides the advantage of using the same language on both ends, TypeScript enables developers to become more productive by using tools that help them to avoid mistakes, like passing the wrong type to a method, and also by making refactoring much easier.

Since we want our application to secure ours users' data, we will use JWT tokens to authorize certain requests. A JWT—which stands for JSON Web Token and is pronounced as "jot"—is a token that provides credibility on an end to end communication. JWTs are getting widely adopted, and they take place as an alternative to the, rather old, cookie based approach. The biggest advantage of JWTs is that they can hold sensitive data, in a readable format, and be trustworthy while getting sent over the network.

Koa is web framework, just like [Express](http://expressjs.com/), that is developed by many of the same people that built Express—by the way, here is a [nice tutorial on how to secure an Angular 2 app backed by Express](https://auth0.com/blog/angular-2-authentication/). Unofficially known as Express' successor, Koa uses `async` functions to improve readability and robustness of applications. Writing middlewares to handle users requests become very easy and clear with Koa's approach, as we will see on our own grocery list application.

## Our Application - Grocery List

The grocery list application will have a very simple and intuitive functionality. Visitors (unknown users) will be able to register themselves or, if they already have registered before, to sign in and manage their current list of items to buy at the grocery store. A user won't be able to have more than one list. The application will look like this:

![Grocery List app built with Angular 2 and Koa](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/koa-angular2/grocery-list-app.png)

The most important files of our source code will be divided in three folders:

1. Client source folder—which will hold our Angular 2 source code.
2. Common source folder—which will hold files that are used by both backend and front-end.
3. Server source folder—which will contain all the code that is responsible for persisting users' data and authenticating them.

## Cloning the Repo

To reach a minimum viable architecture, where we can start developing the real code for our grocery list, we'll need to do some configuration. Angular 2 alone is already considered cumbersome to configure. So, to avoid wasting valuable time, we will use a repo that provides a very good starting point, containing many of the dependencies installed and configured. Leaving us to deal with what matters: Koa's middlewares, Angular's components and JWT tokens' configuration.

This repo was built specifically to be followed alongside with this post, and can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/auth0-blog/grocery-list). So let's clone it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:auth0-blog/grocery-list.git
```

### Node.js and NPM

Now that we have the repository cloned, we need to start configuring our development environment. The most important piece of software that will enable us to use Koa and Angular 2 is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and its package manager, [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). So, in order to continue, we shall first be sure that we have both of them installed with the right version:

```bash
node --version
```

The above command must output, at least, `v7.6.0`, since it is the first version that supports `async` functions. If an error occurs, while issuing this command, or a version prior to that gets printed, please refer to the [download area of Node.js and install the latest version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Having Node.js and NPM correctly installed, we must issue `npm install` on our project's root folder. This command will install, locally, all the runtime and development dependencies that our application has. This command may take a while to run since there are many dependencies.

When the installation finishes, we must issue a `npm run dev` to verify that indeed our project was correctly cloned and that the dependencies were installed. This command will bundle everything and start the Koa server locally on port 3000, so let's head to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and check that our backend is serving the `index.html` file. If it is, you will see a very simple page with the title 'Grocery List' in the navigation bar at the top. This bar will also contain two labels called 'Sign In' and 'Sign Up', but they won't do anything for the time being.

## Grocery List Application's Backend

Everything is now in order and we can begin talking about our backend. This will be a thin layer as it will have only three responsibilities. First it will have to be able to register and retrieve users, second it will have to authorize (or deny) user request and third it will have to be able to manage updates to users grocery lists.

To makes things easier we will map just two classes to represent our entities: a User class, to hold users' data; and a Exception class, to represent errors like unauthorized requests. We won't create a class to represent the grocery list itself because this can be easily managed as a property, an array of strings, in our users.

To provide persistence and guarantee that our users' data is available, all our data will be held by an [in-memory database called LokiJS](http://lokijs.org/). This database has the advantage of being really simple to setup and integrate with Node.js. But first, let's start by configuring Koa and its middlewares.

### Koa

Koa's middlewares, just like Express middlewares, are functions that have access to three things: the request object, that represents the request sent by the user; the response object, that represents what will be sent to the user; and the next middleware in the stack. Middlewares can execute any code to change the request and/or the response object and can decide if the next middleware will get executed or not.

Our application will have three middlewares that will help us providing the functionality that we need.

The first middleware is [koa-bodyparser](https://github.com/koajs/bodyparser). This middleware is responsible for parsing the request sent by the user and it supports three types of content: JSON objects, forms (inputs, select boxes and so on) and text. Whenever we have this middleware configured, we can access the data sent by the user. This is a must-have middleware, and as such our boilerplate repository already comes with it installed and configured.

The second middleware is called [koa-static](https://github.com/koajs/static). As the name indicates, this middleware enables us to serve static files, like an image, or an html file, to our users. Considering that we want our users to be fed with the `index.html` whenever they visit our website, we need this middleware. This is another must-have middleware, so the base project already have this one as well.

The third middleware will be responsible for sending errors formated as JSON objects to our users. Although we could use an existing middleware, like [koa-error](https://github.com/koajs/error), we will build this one from scratch to show how easy it is.

#### The Exception Handler Middleware

Let's begin by creating an `Exception` class to represent expected errors during runtime. Since this class will be useful on our front-end as well, we shall create it, naming as `exception.ts`, in a new folder called `common`. The result must be a file on `./src/common/exception.ts` with the following content:

```typescript
export class Exception extends Error {
    private _statusCode: number;

    constructor(statusCode: number, message: string) {
        super(message);
        this._statusCode = statusCode;
    }

    get statusCode(): number {
        return this._statusCode;
    }

    toObject(): Object {
        return {
            statusCode: this._statusCode,
            message: this.message
        }
    }
}
```

As we can see, what we've just created is responsible for carrying two properties related to errors. A status code, that represents an HTTP status, and a message with the error description.

In order to be able to warn our users properly—i.e. in a JSON object format—about these errors, we have now to create an `exception-handler.middleware.ts` file that will contain our's middleware source code. Create it as a sibling to `app.ts`, under `./src/server/`. The contents of this middleware are very simple:

```typescript
import {Exception} from "../common/exception";

export default async (ctx, next) => {
    try {
        return next();
    } catch (err) {
        if (err instanceof Exception) {
            // it transform the exception to an object literal
            ctx.body = err.toObject();
            ctx.status = err.statusCode;
        } else {
            // unknow error
            ctx.body = { message: 'Unexpected error.' };
            ctx.status = 500;
        }
    }
};
```

Reading this file from top to bottom, we can see that it first declares a dependency on the previously created `./src/common/exception.ts` file and, after that, exports an `async` function. This function passes the control to the next middlewares in the stack, to let them process the requests, while keeping sure that if any errors occurs on them it gets catch and then informed to the user as an object literal.

Defining the `Exception` class and the `exception-handler` middleware is not enough. We also have to change `./src/app.ts` to make our Koa server use these new resources.

```typescript
// ... other imports

// import the newly defined exception handler middleware
import exceptionHandler from "./exception-handler.middleware";

// ... previou configs and middlewares

// make Koa server use the middleware
SERVER.use(exceptionHandler);
SERVER.use(ROUTER.routes());

SERVER.listen(3000);
```

It is important to note that the `exception-handler` middleware must be configured *before* the `ROUTER.routes()` middleware. Defining it like that enables our handler to call the routers that we will define later, and handle any exceptions and errors that might occur on them.

### User's Class and LokiJS Database

We have now a backend application that is capable of serving static files, parsing user requests and handling exceptions. So let's start creating the representation of our users and then create a class that will help us persist these users.

Our `User` class implementation is straightforward. Create a file called `user.ts` in the same folder of `exception.ts`, which is `./src/common/`, and then add the following code:

```typescript
export class User {
    public email: string;
    public password: string;
    public name: string;
    public token: string;
    public items: Array<string>;

    public static OnSerialized(instance : User, json : any) : void {
        delete json.password;
        delete json.meta;
    }
}
```

Besides the five properties defined in this class, there is one fancy element, the static `OnSerialized` method, that worths a mention. To avoid sending over the wire the users password and a property called meta, that only LokiJS cares about, we will use a `Serialize` function that is part of a package entitled [cerialize](https://github.com/weichx/cerialize). Whenever we use this `Serialize` function, this `OnSerialized` gets called and removes the mentioned properties, sending only the data that we want to send.

Now, the user database helper, which we will create as a new file called `user.dao.ts` on `./src/server/user/`, will contain three methods that will allow us to persist and retrieve users and a method to bootstrap the database collection.

```typescript
import { User } from '../../common/user';

class UserDAO {
    private USER_DB: LokiCollection<{}>;

    configure(DB: Loki) {
        let instance = this;
        DB.loadDatabase({}, function () {
            instance.USER_DB = DB.getCollection('user');
            if (!instance.USER_DB) {
                instance.USER_DB = DB.addCollection('user');
            }
        });
    }

    insertUser(user: User) {
        this.USER_DB.insert(user);
    }

    findByEmail(email: string): any {
        return this.USER_DB.findOne({ email });
    }

    update(user: User): void {
        let persistedUser = this.findByEmail(user.email);
        persistedUser.items = user.items;
        this.USER_DB.update(persistedUser);
    }
}

export const SINGLETON: UserDAO = new UserDAO();  
```

The first method defined, `configure`, will be later called with an instance of a LokiJS database. This instance will then be used to get the `user` collection or, if it was not created yet, create this collection. The other three methods are pretty self-explanatory. We call `insertUser` to insert new users, `findByEmail` to find an user by the e-mail address and `update` to make the user's new data persistent.

Last thing that we have to do, to have a user collection to hold some data, is to setup LokiJS within our backend and then configure the `UserDAO` class to use it. So, on `./src/server/app.ts`, let's make the following changes:

```typescript
// ... previous imports

// import LokiJS and UserDAO
import * as Lokijs from "lokijs";
import {SINGLETON as UserDAO} from "./user/user.dao";

const DB = new Lokijs('grocery-list.json', {
    autosave: true
});

UserDAO.configure(DB);

// ... everything else
```

This change is small and simple. There are only three steps that we need to follow:

1. Import LokiJS and `UserDAO`.
2. Configure a new instance of LokiJS, defining a system file that will hold our data while our server is not up.
3. And then call `configure` method on our singleton `UserDAO`, passing to it the LokiJS database instance.

So far we have only called the method that configures `UserDAO`. The other ones, that enables us to retrieve and update users, are yet to be used.

Next we will create a route to allow a user to be updated.

### Handling User Update

To be able to update our users grocery list, we now have to create our first Koa's route. The project that we've cloned already contains one route, defined on `./src/app.routes.ts`, that serves the `index.html` file whenever an unknown URL is called. We do this to allow the Angular 2 front-end application, that we are going to build, handle routes by itself.

Creating a Koa route to handle updates on users is a straightforward process. Let's create a file called `user.routes.ts` on `./src/server/user/` with the following code:

```typescript
import {SINGLETON as UserDAO} from "./user.dao";

export default {
    path: '/api/update-list',
    middleware: async (ctx, next) => {
        let user = UserDAO.findByEmail(ctx.state.user.email);
        user.items = ctx.request.body.items;
        UserDAO.update(user);
        ctx.body = {};
    }
}
```

All that we do in this file is export a object literal with two properties. The first property, called `path`, represents the URL that will be requested by external resources, like our front-end, to update the a user's grocery list. The second property, called `middleware`, contains the `async` function that will handle such requests.

This function acts as a last resource in a request, since it does not call `next();` like the previous one that we've built. It simply retrieves a user object, base on the user's e-mail, and then update this user with the new items sent within the `ctx.request.body`.

Notice that we use two different objects to get data from the request. The second object, `ctx.request.body`, contains the new information sent by the user and it is under `koa-bodyparser`'s responsibility to parse it properly. The first object, `ctx.state.user` does not exist yet. We still have to find a way to identify whose request we are handling, but first we have to wire our new route to our application:

```typescript
// ... koa router and fs imports

import UPDATE_LIST_ROUTE from "./user/user.routes";

// ... other routes

ROUTER.post(UPDATE_LIST_ROUTE.path, UPDATE_LIST_ROUTE.middleware);

export default ROUTER;
```

The code snippet above has to be inserted on `./src/server/app.routes.ts`. First we import our route and, after other routes already defined on this file, we register it on the main `ROUTER` object, configuring it to handle post requests for the defined `path`.

### Authentication and Authorization

We now have the endpoint that will handle updates on users list integrated on the backend and ready to work. But we are still missing a way to authorize a user to issue such an update and, more than that, we still don't have an endpoint to authenticate existing users and register new ones. These are the last features that we have to implement on our backend, so let's dig into them.

First thing that we will do is to create a file called `authentication.routes.ts` under `./src/server/` folder with the following content:

```typescript
// routes
import {SINGLETON as UserDAO} from "./user/user.dao";
import {Exception} from '../common/exception';
import { sign, verify } from "jsonwebtoken";
import {Serialize} from "cerialize";

const SUPER_SECRET = 'change-this';

export const SIGN_UP = {
    path: '/api/sign-up',
    middleware: async (ctx, next) => {
        let user = UserDAO.findByEmail(ctx.request.body.email);
        if (user) {
            throw new Exception(401, 'E-mail already registered.');
        }
        UserDAO.insertUser(ctx.request.body);
        user = UserDAO.findByEmail(ctx.request.body.email);
        ctx.body = {
            token: sign(user, SUPER_SECRET),
            user: Serialize(user)
        };
    }
};

export const SIGN_IN = {
    path: '/api/sign-in',
    middleware: async (ctx, next) => {
        let user = UserDAO.findByEmail(ctx.request.body.email);
        if (user && ctx.request.body.password == user.password) {
            ctx.body = {
                token: sign(user, SUPER_SECRET),
                user: Serialize(user)
            };
        } else {
            throw new Exception(401, 'Uknown user');
        }
    }
};

export const SECURED_ROUTES = {
    path: /^\/api\/(.*)(?:\/|$)/,
    middleware: async (ctx, next) => {
        try {
            let token = ctx.request.headers['authorization'];
            ctx.state.user = verify(token.replace('Bearer ', ''), SUPER_SECRET);
            return next();
        } catch (err) {
            throw new Exception(401, 'Uknown user');
        }
    }
};
```
This new file exports three `async` functions that will act like routes, let's dive into the first two of them:

1. The first one will respond to `/api/sign-up` post requests and it will enable new users to register to our application.
2. The second one is going to be tied up to `/api/sign-in` in order to allow (or deny) an user to use the application. This is done based on an e-mail and a password informed by the user.

Both middlewares described above respond to the user in the same way. If they are fed with proper data they send back a JSON response containing a token—issued by a function called `sign` of the [jsonwebtoken package](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)—and the user data, which contains its e-mail address, its name and its list of items to buy at the grocery store. In case the user sends improper data, like a wrong combination of e-mail and password, or tries to register with an e-mail that is already registered, both middlewares answer with an exception describing the problem.

The third middleware acts as a key component on our backend. As we can see, the path that it will answer to is a regular expression. This regular expression makes this middleware activate on any request sent to paths that begins with `/api/`, and what it does is to check if a valid token is informed on the `authorization` header request. This verification occurs with the help of `verify` function of the [jsonwebtoken package](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken).

`Sign` and `verify` functions work together to secure our users' data. Whenever a request is sent to any of the protected endpoints, `verify` takes control and ties a user object literal, that is retrieved from the token, to the `ctx.state.user` reference. This token *must* be present and signed with the same secret ingredient, which is done by the `verify` function when the user authenticated or registered.

So, that is how we guarantee that our user is who he claims to be. A Token data can be read by anyone anywhere, but its content cannot be changed because if it is, the `verify` function will complain that it cannot assert this content.

Now it's time to register these new routes on our backend application. To do so, open the `./src/server/app.routes.ts` file and add the following code:

```typescript
// ... previous imports

import { SIGN_IN, SIGN_UP, SECURED_ROUTES } from "./authentication.routes";

// ... LOAD_HTML function declaration and middleware that uses it

ROUTER.post(SIGN_IN.path, SIGN_IN.middleware);
ROUTER.post(SIGN_UP.path, SIGN_UP.middleware);
ROUTER.post(SECURED_ROUTES.path, SECURED_ROUTES.middleware);

ROUTER.post(UPDATE_LIST_ROUTE.path, UPDATE_LIST_ROUTE.middleware);

export default ROUTER;
```

It is important to notice that order matters when defining middlewares and routes on Koa. Each middleware/route can decide wether the next one on the stack must execute or not. So we must define `SIGN_IN` and `SIGN_OUT` *before* the `SECURED_ROUTES` middleware and the three of them must also be defined *before* `UPDATE_LIST_ROUTE`.

Like so, we finish writing our backend, which has now every feature that we desire secured, and can focus on the front-end development with Angular 2.

## Angular 2 Front-End - the Final Boundary

The repository that we've cloned already comes with a basic Angular 2 application that is bootable. But it doesn't really do anything useful and, as so, we must create the components that will allow our users to register, authenticate and manage their lists.

There are three components that we will have to create - `SignInComponent`, `SignUpComponent` and `GroceryListComponent` - alongside with a `RouterModule` to handle front-end's states, an `AuthenticatedGuard` that will prevent unknown users to access protected areas, an `AuthenticationService` that will be used by the first two components and a `GlobalErrorHandler` that will catch any error and warn the user.

As we can see, even in a simple application as our grocery list, there is a very good number of moving parts. So let's get to them.

### Handling Errors Globally

The first moving part that we are going to attack is the `GlobalErrorHandler`. This handler will enable us to warn the user when an expected error occur, like badly informed credentials. Creating this handler is quite simple, first we create a file called `global-error-handler.ts` under `./src/client/app/` with the following content:

```typescript
import { ErrorHandler } from "@angular/core";

import { Exception } from '../../common/exception';

export class GlobalErrorHandler implements ErrorHandler {
    handleError(error : any) {
        if (error.rejection && typeof error.rejection.json == 'function') {
            let myErrorObj: Exception = error.rejection.json();
            alert(myErrorObj.statusCode + ': ' + myErrorObj.message);
        } else {
            console.log(error);
        }
    }
}
```

Notice that our `GlobalErrorHandler` uses the common `Exception` class that we've created before. This is used to tightly type the error coming over the wire and then to be able to refer to the status code and error message.

Now we have to register it on the main application module, that is hold by the `./src/client/app/app.module.ts` file:

```typescript
// ... previous imports

import {GlobalErrorHandler} from "./global-error-handler";

@NgModule({
    // ... other statements
    providers: [
        { provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: GlobalErrorHandler }
    ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Registering it to become our `ErrorHandler` is easy. As we can see in the snippet above, it is just a matter of telling Angular that whenever it needs `ErrorHandler`, it must actually use `GlobalErrorHandler` class.

### Authentication Service on the Front-End

After configuring a way to handle errors on our front-end application, it is time to create our first and only Angular 2 service. This service will be responsible for both authentication and sign up, and it is going to be called `AuthenticationService`. Let's create a file called `authentication.service.ts`, in `./src/client/app/` folder, to handle these features for us.

```typescript
import {Injectable} from "@angular/core";
import {Http} from "@angular/http";
import "rxjs/add/operator/toPromise";
import {User} from "../../common/user";
import {Router} from "@angular/router";

@Injectable()
export class AuthenticationService {
    private _user: User;

    constructor(private http: Http, private router: Router) { }

    private onAuthenticated(response: any): void {
        this._user = response.json().user;
        localStorage.setItem('token', response.json().token);
        this.router.navigate(['/grocery-list']);
    }

    authenticate(email: string, password: string): Promise<void> {
        return this.http.post('/api/sign-in', { email, password })
            .toPromise()
            .then(response => this.onAuthenticated.call(this, response));
    }

    signUp(user: User): Promise<void> {
        return this.http.post('/api/sign-up', user)
            .toPromise()
            .then(response => this.onAuthenticated.call(this, response));
    }

    user(): User {
        return this._user;
    }
}
```

This service only has three public methods: one to `authenticate` an user based on an e-mail and a password that are passed as parameters; another one to allow a new user to `signUp` to our application; and third method that returns the `user` authenticated, or null.

Both `authenticate` and `signUp` methods have a very similar behavior. The first one makes a call, through the Angular 2 `Http` component, to `/api/sign-in` endpoint passing an object literal containing the user's e-mail and password. If the backend sends back a successful response, then `authenticate` method handles this response to the private method called `onAuthenticated`. This private method then takes three steps:

1. It takes the user's data sent back and keeps it on the service memory, under the `_user` property.
2. It gets the JWT token sent by the server and registers it on the `localStorage` under the `token` key.
3. Sends the user to the `/grocery-list` Angular 2 route (yet to be defined).

The `signUp` method proceeds almost in the exactly same way. The difference is that it sends the users name, in parallel with their e-mail and password, and the endpoint also changes to `/api/sign-up`. But, if the request gets a successful response, this methods proceeds exactly the same way as the `authenticate` method, passing the response to `onAuthenticated` private method.

Also, it is important to notice that if any error is sent back from the server, then `GlobalErrorHandler` previously defined handles the error by showing it to the user through an `alert(message)` call.

Lastly, let's not forget to register this service within our `AppModule`, that is located at `./src/client/app/app.module.ts`. Simple task, just add it as a provider below our `GlobalErrorHandler`:

```typescript
// ... other imports

import {AuthenticationService} from "./authentication.service";

@NgModule({
    // ... previous definitions

    providers: [
        { provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: GlobalErrorHandler },
        AuthenticationService
    ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

The difference between both declarations occur due to the fact that `GlobalErrorHandler` works as a substitute to the default `ErrorHandler`, while `AuthenticationService` does not substitute anything, it will get injected on the components that we will create.

### Sign Up Component Definition

Now we will start working on the three components that compose our application, the first that we will investigate is the `SignUpComponent`. Its definition is very easy, as the heavy work is done by the `AuthenticationService`. Create a new file called `sign-up.component.ts` in a new folder called `sign-up` under `./src/client/app/` and paste the following code:

```typescript
import {Component} from "@angular/core";
import {AuthenticationService} from "../authentication.service";
import {User} from "../../../common/user";

@Component({
    selector: 'sign-up',
    templateUrl: './sign-up.component.html'
})
export class SignUpComponent {
    user: User = new User();

    constructor(private authenticationService: AuthenticationService) { }

    signUp(): void {
        this.authenticationService
            .signUp(this.user);
    }
}
```

We will also need to create the `sign-up.component.html` that is referenced by this component. Create it right next to the component definition and paste the following HTML code:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <h2>Fill your data.</h2>
            <form (ngSubmit)="signUp()">
                <div class="form-group">
                    <label for="name">Full name</label>
                    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="user.name" id="name" name="name">
                </div>
                <div class="form-group">
                    <label for="email">E-mail address</label>
                    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="user.email" id="email" name="email">
                </div>
                <div class="form-group">
                    <label for="password">Password</label>
                    <input type="password" [(ngModel)]="user.password" id="password" name="password">
                </div>
                <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Sign Up!</button>
            </form>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

This component, and its template, works in a simple way. It just define a dependency to `AuthenticationService`, a property of the type `User` and a method `signUp`. Whenever our users reach this component, they will be facing a form with three input texts: one to fulfill with the user's name; another one to fulfill with the user's e-mail address; and the last one with to fill with the desired password. After filling these fields, the user will have to submit the form by clicking the `Sign Up!` button, which will trigger the `signUp` method that we have just defined. This `signUp` method only has one responsibility, to pass the user's data to `AuthenticationService.signUp` method.

### Sign In Component Definition

The next component that we are going to define is `SignInComponent` and it is extremely similar to the `SignUpComponent`. This component will also have its own folder, so let's create a `sign-in` under `./src/client/app/` and add a file called `sign-in.component.ts` to it with the code below:

```typescript
import {Component} from "@angular/core";
import {AuthenticationService} from "../authentication.service";

@Component({
    selector: 'sign-in',
    templateUrl: './sign-in.component.html'
})
export class SignInComponent {

    email: string;
    password: string;

    constructor(private authenticationService: AuthenticationService) { }

    signIn(): void {
        this.authenticationService
            .authenticate(this.email, this.password);
    }
}
```

Similarly to `SignUpComponent`, we also have to define a template to be used by this component. So we must add a file called `sign-in.component.html` besides the previous file and add the following HTML template:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <h2>Enter your credentials.</h2>
            <form (ngSubmit)="signIn()">
                <div class="form-group">
                    <label for="email">E-mail address</label>
                    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="email"
                           id="email" name="email">
                </div>
                <div class="form-group">
                    <label for="password">Password</label>
                    <input type="password" [(ngModel)]="password"
                           id="password" name="password">
                </div>
                <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Sign In!</button>
            </form>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

As we can see the only difference between both components is that the last one does not asks for the user's name and calls `AuthenticationService.signIn` method instead of `AuthenticationService.signUp`. These components could easily be merged into a single `SignInSignUpComponent`, but let's follow the [single-responsiblity principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and keep things separate.

### AuthHttp Configuration

Before moving ahead to the `GroceryListComponent` we must first configure a great component called `AuthHttp`. This component belongs to the [angular2-jwt package](https://github.com/auth0/angular2-jwt) and it makes communicating with secured backend very easy.

Since we have already followed the convention stated on its documentation - i.e. we have saved ours users' JWT token under the `id_token` on the `localStorage` - it is just a matter of configuring our `AppModule` to use it as a `provider` and then defining this class as a dependency to whatever component needs it (like we are going to do with `GroceryListComponent`).

So, let's open the `./src/client/app/app.module.ts` file and add this class as a provider:

```typescript
// ... previous imports

import {AUTH_PROVIDERS} from "angular2-jwt";

@NgModule({
    // ... previous configuration

    providers: [
        // ... previous providers
        AUTH_PROVIDERS
    ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

### Grocery List Component Definition

Now we finally get to the real deal component. The `GroceryListComponent` is what the users are really interested in. This component will be responsible for three things: letting the users see theirs current grocery list; letting the users add new items, through a form, to their lists; and letting the user remove an item by tap/clicking it. Again, two files will be needed. The first one is the component definition with its methods, and the second one is the component HTML template.

Let's begin by creating a new folder called `grocery-list` under `./src/client/app/`. Then we must create a file called `grocery-list.component.ts`, on this new folder, with the following content:

```typescript
import {Component} from "@angular/core";
import {AuthenticationService} from "../authentication.service";
import {User} from "../../../common/user";
import {AuthHttp} from "angular2-jwt";

@Component({
    selector: 'panel-component',
    templateUrl: './grocery-list.component.html',
    styles: [`
        .jumbotron p { font-size: 1em; }
        .jumbotron form { margin-bottom: 1em; }
    `]
})
export class GroceryListComponent {
    private updateList = '/api/update-list';
    newItem: string;

    constructor (private authenticationService: AuthenticationService, private authHttp: AuthHttp) { }

    private updateUsersList() {
        this.authHttp.post(this.updateList, this.getUser())
            .subscribe(
                data => this.newItem = null,
                err => console.log(err)
            );
    }

    getItems() : Array<string> {
        return this.getUser().items;
    }

    addItem() : void {
        if (this.newItem && this.newItem.trim() != '') {
            if (!this.getUser().items) {
                this.getUser().items = [];
            }

            this.getUser().items.push(this.newItem);
            this.updateUsersList();
        }
    }

    removeItem(index: number) : void {
        this.getUser().items.splice(index, 1);
        this.updateUsersList();
    }

    private getUser(): User {
        return this.authenticationService.user();
    }
}
```

This component definition is far bigger than the previous ones, but it is also easy to grasp its content. What it does is to provide three public methods that will be called by the template:

1. The first method, called `getItem` simply returns a list of `items`, that belongs to the current logged-in `user`. This list is then showed, by the template, to the user so he can see what does he have to buy.
2. The second method, called `addItem`, is responsible for checking if the user has informed a new item, through the `ctx.newItem` property, and then to call the `updateUsersList` private method. This method is also called by the next public method and what it does is to issue a post request, through the `AuthHttp` object, to update the user's list.
3. The third and final method is responsible for enabling the user to remove an item. This method is linked to every single item of the list on the template, and whenever one is tapped/clicked, this method is called with the index of the selected item. Then it simply calls the `updateUsersList` private method, updating the user's list on the backend.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <h2>This is your grocery list.</h2>
            <p>Use the form below to add an item, or click in one on the list to remove it.</p>
            <form (ngSubmit)="addItem()">
                <div class="input-group">
                    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="newItem" name="newItem"
                           class="form-control" placeholder="New item...">
                    <span class="input-group-btn">
                        <button class="btn btn-default" type="submit">Add</button>
                    </span>
                </div>
            </form>
            <div class="list-group">
                <a class="list-group-item" (click)="removeItem(i)"
                   *ngFor="let item of getItems(); let i = index">
                    {{ item }}
                </a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The above HTML code is the template that the `GroceryListComponent` expects to find on `./src/client/app/grocery-list/grocery-list.component.html`, so let's create this file and paste this snippet. As we can see here, the template contains: a form that enables the user to inform a new item; and a list of items - which is populated by the [\*ngFor Angular 2 directive](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html). Each item on this list also contains a `(click)` event defined to call the `removeItem` method on the component.

### Defining the Routes and their Guard

We are getting really close to having a fully functional grocery list application, but there are a few more steps that we have to take. First we will need to define a [guard](https://angular.io/guide/router#milestone-5-route-guards), called `AuthenticatedGuard`, that will prevent the users to reach the grocery list component if they did not authenticate. For that, let's create a file called `authenticated.guard.ts` under `./src/client/app/` with the code snippet below:

```typescript
import {CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot, Router} from "@angular/router";
import {Observable} from "rxjs";
import {AuthenticationService} from "./authentication.service";
import {Injectable} from "@angular/core";

@Injectable()
export class AuthenticatedGuard implements CanActivate {
    constructor(private authenticationService : AuthenticationService, private router: Router) { }

    canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot):
                Observable<boolean> | Promise<boolean> | boolean {
        if (this.authenticationService.user() != null) {
            return true;
        }
        this.router.navigate(['/']);
        return false;
    }
}
```

This guard has as dependency on our `AuthenticationService` and uses it whenever someone tries to activate a route that is wired to it. The `canActivate` method is what blocks or enables a user to move ahead. If the user has not authenticated yet, he or she is redirected to the root route, which will show the sign-in form.

Having defined the guard we are now able to define our routes. This will be done in a new file called `app.routing.ts`. Create this file under `./src/client/app` and add the following code:

```typescript
import {RouterModule} from "@angular/router";

import {SignInComponent} from "./sign-in/sign-in.component";
import {SignUpComponent} from "./sign-up/sign-up.component";
import {GroceryListComponent} from "./grocery-list/grocery-list.component";
import {AuthenticatedGuard} from "./authenticated.guard";

const APP_ROUTES = [
    { path: '', component: SignInComponent },
    { path: 'sign-up', component: SignUpComponent },
    { path: 'grocery-list', component: GroceryListComponent, canActivate: [AuthenticatedGuard] }
];

export const Routing = RouterModule.forRoot(APP_ROUTES);
```

This code creates a constant array called `APP_ROUTES` that contains all the three routes that our application have. They are:

1. The root route - identified by an empty string `''` - is tied up with the `SignInComponent` and, as such, shows the sign-in form whenever reached. This will be available at the root path of our domain (e.g. [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) or [http://www.mydomain.com/](http://www.mydomain.com/)).
2. The `sign-up` route, which will be shown when a user navigate to `/sign-up` path, is wired to `SignUpComponent` and enables users to register to our application.
3. The `grocery-list` route that presents the list of items to be managed by the user. This route, which has as path `/grocery-list` is the only route that is guarded by the `AuthenticatedGuard`. So, whenever a user tries to activate it, the guardian verifies if the user is authenticated and then it decides whether the can navigate to it or not.

Having ours routes defined we must now update the main template, which is located at `./src/client/app/app.component.html`, adding these routes to the hyperlinks on it. Open this file and update it as follows:

{% highlight html %}
<nav class="navbar navbar-default">
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Brand and toggle get grouped for better mobile display -->
        <div class="navbar-header">
            <a class="navbar-brand" [routerLink]="['']">{{title}}</a>
        </div>
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav pull-right">
            <li><a [routerLink]="['']">Sign In</a></li>
            <li><a [routerLink]="['sign-up']">Sign Up</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</nav>
<section>
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</section>
{% endhighlight %}

Also, notice that we must add a `router-outlet` tag to the `section` tag. This is where our components will get rendered.

### Wiring Everything Up in the AppModule

We have now every single piece of the front-end defined, but, before being able to execute our application completely for the first time, we have one last step. Angular 2 forces us to define every single component used in a module in the module definition, in our case in the `AppModule` (which is located at `./src/client/app/app.module.ts`). Fortunately this is a trivial task. Open the module's file and update it as follows:

```typescript
// ... previous imports

import {AuthenticatedGuard} from "./authenticated.guard";
import {Routing} from "./app.routing";
import {GroceryListComponent} from "./grocery-list/grocery-list.component";
import {SignUpComponent} from "./sign-up/sign-up.component";
import {SignInComponent} from "./sign-in/sign-in.component";

@NgModule({
    bootstrap: [ AppComponent ],
    declarations: [
        AppComponent, SignInComponent, SignUpComponent, GroceryListComponent
    ],
    imports: [
        BrowserModule, HttpModule, FormsModule, Routing
    ],
    providers: [
        { provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: GlobalErrorHandler },
        AuthenticationService,
        AuthenticatedGuard,
        AUTH_PROVIDERS
    ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Note that we have added five imports - being three components, the `Routing` declaration and the `AuthenticatedGuard` - and that the imported elements must be properly set in the correct place. That is, the three components must be added in the `declarations` array, the `Routing` must be add to the `imports` array and the `AuthenticatedGuard` must be added to the `providers` array.

And then finally we have reached the point where we have a fully functional grocery list. To see it working just issue `npm run dev` in the root folder of our project and, when it finishes the building process, head to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and play with our app.

## Aside: Softening the Authentication Burden with Auth0

Creating the authentication mechanisnm was not the hardest task but, for every single application that we build, we will have to recreate or reuse at least two components: one for the front-end application, that will show sign in and sign up forms; and one to handle identity persistence and retrieval.

Further more, if we want to support identity providers (like Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc), [multifactor authentication](https://auth0.com/multifactor-authentication), and so on, then our task will start to become harder. But fear not, [Auth0](https://auth0.com) is here to make our lives easier and more secure.

> **Note:** the refactoring below can be found fully implemented in the `auth0` branch of the [Grocery List app repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/grocery-list/tree/jwt) on GitHub.

### Configuring Your Auth0 Client

If you haven't done so yet, this is a good time to <a href="javascript:signup()">sign up for a free Auth0 account</a>, after which we can take a look at how we need to alter our grocery list to allow for Auth0 to manage our login.

> [Auth0 offers a generous **free tier**](https://auth0.com/pricing) to get started with modern authentication.

When we first reach Auth0's [dashboard](https://dashboard.auth0.com), we are asked what identity providers we want to use. Since our application is intended for end users, we can choose only Google, which shall cover many of the users around. Those that are not covered can still input an e-mail address and a password to sign up.

After that we must go to [APIs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis) and create a new one that will represent our grocery list. To create an API, we must define three fields: `Name`, which is just a friendly name for our new API; `Identifier`, which is a `String` that we will use when requesting an `access_token`; and the `Signing Algorithm`, which defines if this API will use a [symmetric or asymmetric algorithm](https://auth0.com/blog/json-web-token-signing-algorithms-overview/) to sign the `access_token`. In our case, we will fill this fields, respectively, with: `Grocery List API`; `grocery-list-api`; and `RS256` (i.e. we will use an asymmetric algorithm).

![Creating the grocery list API on Auth0](https://cdn2.auth0.com/blog/koa-angular2/creating-api.png)

> An API is an entity that represents an external resource server, capable of accepting and responding resource requests made by clients (resource owners). And this is exactly what our grocery list app is, an API that holds the grocery list of our users.

**Note:** If you don't already have the APIs menu item, you can enable it by going to your [Account Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/account) and in the [Advanced tab](https://manage.auth0.com/#/account/advanced), scroll down until you see *Enable APIs Section* and flip the switch.

When we created the API, Auth0 automatically created a client for us, which was called *Grocery List API (Test Client)*. Let's open up this client and copy the `Client ID` from it. It will be used as a parameter on the configuration that we will do in our Angular 2 app. While we're viewing this client in the Auth0 dashboard, let's scroll down to find a section entitled *Allowed Callback URLs*. Here we will add the URL that Auth0 will redirect the user to after a successful authentication. Therefore, let's add `http://localhost:3000/callback` to this field.

### Updating the Backend's Source Code

Since we won't handle sign in and sign up features by ourselves anymore, the first file that we will update is the `src/server/authentication.routes.ts`. The security middleware, defined in this file, will use `jwks-rsa` library to load the `signingKey` of the API that we created above. Therefore, let's issue `npm install jwks-rsa --save` to install this dependency, and then update the file as follows:

```typescript
import * as jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
let jwks = require('jwks-rsa');

const client = jwks({
    jwksUri: 'https://{YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN}/.well-known/jwks.json'
});

const VERIFY_JWT = function(ctx, kid, token) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve) {
        client.getSigningKey(kid, (err, key) => {
            let signingKey = key.publicKey || key.rsaPublicKey;
            let accessKey = jwt.verify(token, signingKey);
            ctx.state.user = {
                sub: accessKey.sub
            };
            resolve();
        });
    });
};

export const SECURED_ROUTES = {
    path: /^\/api\/(.*)(?:\/|$)/,
    middleware: async (ctx, next) => {
        if (! ctx.request.headers.authorization) {
            ctx.status = 401;
            return ctx.body = {
                message: 'Unauthorized'
            };
        }
        let token = ctx.request.headers.authorization.replace('Bearer ', '');
        let kid = jwt.decode(token, {complete: true}).header.kid;

        await VERIFY_JWT(ctx, kid, token);
        return next();
    }
};
```

 As you can see, we have removed the `SIGN_UP` and `SIGN_IN` constants, used `jwks-rsa` to get the signing key of the token that we receive in the `Authorization` header, and then used `jsonwebtoken` to validate its contents. Please, note that `{YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN}` above has to be replace with your Auth0 domain, something like `bkrebs.auth0.com`.

Another file that will need to be updated is `src/server/user/user.routes.ts`. Before using Auth0, our users were registered in our application with the `SIGN_UP` middleware that we have removed. Now we will have to register users in our database on the first time they use our application.

Besides that, whenever a user signed in, our backend used to send the list of items with the sign in response. So we will also need a way to send the grocery list to our users. Both situations will be handled by a new middleware that we will create. The final version of the file will look like this:

```typescript
// routes
import {SINGLETON as UserDAO} from "./user.dao";

export const UPDATE_LIST = {
    path: '/api/update-list',
    middleware: async ctx => {
        let user = UserDAO.findByEmail(ctx.state.user.sub);
        user.items = ctx.request.body.items;
        UserDAO.update(user);
        ctx.body = {};
    }
};

export const GET_LIST = {
    path: '/api/list',
    middleware: async (ctx, next) => {
        let user = UserDAO.findByEmail(ctx.state.user.sub);
        if (!user) {
            // new users must be persisted before being able to fill data
            user = {
                email: ctx.state.user.sub,
                items: []
            };
            UserDAO.insertUser(user);
        }
        ctx.body = user.items;
        console.log('next');
        return next();
    }
};
```

As we can see here, we had to change the file to stop exporting a single literal object and start exporting two constants: `UPDATE_LIST` which already existed before but didn't have a name; and `GET_LIST`, which is responsible for persisting new users and for sending back their grocery lists.

TypeScript will now be complaining that we are trying to insert a user without a password, a name and a token. We don't need to handle this information anymore, Auth0 handles it for us and we can trust that whatever is sent by Auth0 is true, through JWT verification. Therefore we have to update `src/common/user.ts` to be the following:

```typescript
export class User {
    public email: string;
    public sub: string;
    public items: Array<string>;

    public static OnSerialized(instance : User, json : any) : void {
        delete json.meta;
    }
}
```

Now that we have added the new route to allow users to retrieve their grocery lists, we need to update the main file that handles routes. So, let's open `src/server/app.routes.ts` and change it to become the following:

```typescript
import * as Router from "koa-router";
import * as fs from "fs";
// updating import from user.routes
import {UPDATE_LIST, GET_LIST} from "./user/user.routes";
import {SECURED_ROUTES} from "./authentication.routes";

const ROUTER = new Router();

const LOAD_HTML = function() {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        fs.readFile('./dev/client/index.html', {'encoding': 'utf8'}, function (err, data) {
            if(err) return reject(err);
            resolve(data);
        });
    });
};

ROUTER.get(/^\/(.*)(?:\/|$)/, async (ctx, next) => {
    if (ctx.request.url.startsWith("/api")) {
        return next();
    } else {
        ctx.body = await LOAD_HTML();
    }
});

ROUTER.post(SECURED_ROUTES.path, SECURED_ROUTES.middleware);
// securing any path that is 'GET' from now on
ROUTER.get(SECURED_ROUTES.path, SECURED_ROUTES.middleware);

ROUTER.post(UPDATE_LIST.path, UPDATE_LIST.middleware);
// adding the new '/api/list' endpoint
ROUTER.get(GET_LIST.path, GET_LIST.middleware);

export default ROUTER;
```

There were just a few modifications that we had to do. The following is a summary of what we have changed in this file:

1. We changed how we imported from `user.routes`, since we now have two constants being exported and not a single default one.
2. We removed the `SIGN_IN` and `SIGN_UP` routes that we were importing from `authentication.routes`.
3. We removed the two lines that were registering the `SIGN_IN` and `SIGN_UP` middlewares to `ROUTER.post`.
4. We secured the middlewares registered to `ROUTER.get`.
5. Lastly, we have registered the new middleware that enables users to retrieve their lists.

With that we end the modifications needed on our backend. Let's focus now on our front-end.

### Updating the Front-end's Source Code

Now that our backend is ready to handle JWT tokens sent by Auth0 and that the parts that are not needed anymore (sign in and sign up features) were removed, we can configure our Angular 2 application to use [Auth0's Lock component](https://auth0.com/lock).

Let's start by removing the front-end components that we don't need anymore. To do that we remove the following two folders: `src/client/app/sign-in/` and `src/client/app/sign-up/`. And then we remove their declarations from `src/client/app/app.routing.ts`, making this file look like:

```typescript
import {RouterModule} from "@angular/router";

import {GroceryListComponent} from "./grocery-list/grocery-list.component";
import {AuthenticatedGuard} from "./authenticated.guard";

const APP_ROUTES = [
    { path: 'grocery-list', component: GroceryListComponent, canActivate: [AuthenticatedGuard] }
];

export const Routing = RouterModule.forRoot(APP_ROUTES);
```

We will also have to remove both components from `src/client/app/app.module.ts`. We start by removing their imports from this file and then we remove them from `declarations` property of `@NgModule` configuration object. Like illustrated below:

```typescript
// remove only the following two lines from imports
import {SignInComponent} from "./sign-in/sign-in.component";
import {SignUpComponent} from "./sign-up/sign-up.component";


@NgModule({
    // previous config

    // leave only AppComponent and GroceryListComponent
    declarations: [
        AppComponent, GroceryListComponent
    ],

    // remaining config
})
export class AppModule { }
```

After that, let's open the `src/client/app/authentication.service.ts` file and update it as follows:

```typescript
import {Injectable} from "@angular/core";
import "rxjs/add/operator/toPromise";
import {Router} from "@angular/router";
import {User} from "../../common/user";
import {JwtHelper, tokenNotExpired} from "angular2-jwt";

@Injectable()
export class AuthenticationService {
    private _user: User;

    constructor(private router: Router) {
    }

    // Helper function that will allow us to extract the access_token and id_token
    getParameterByName(name: string) {
        let match = RegExp('[#&]' + name + '=([^&]*)').exec(window.location.hash);
        return match && decodeURIComponent(match[1].replace(/\+/g, ' '));
    }

    // Get and store access_token in local storage
    getAccessToken() {
        let accessToken = this.getParameterByName('access_token');
        localStorage.setItem('token', accessToken);
    }

    // Get and store id_token in local storage
    getIdToken() {
        let idToken = this.getParameterByName('id_token');
        localStorage.setItem('id_token', idToken);
        this.decodeIdToken(idToken);
    }

    // Decode id_token to verify the nonce
    decodeIdToken(token: string) {
        let jwtHelper = new JwtHelper();
        let jwt = jwtHelper.decodeToken(token);
        this._user = new User();
        this._user.email = jwt.email;
        this.verifyNonce(jwt.nonce);
    }

    // Function to generate a nonce which will be used to mitigate replay attacks
    generateNonce() {
        let existing = localStorage.getItem('nonce');
        if (existing === null) {
            let nonce = '';
            let possible = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789';
            for (let i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
                nonce += possible.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * possible.length));
            }
            localStorage.setItem('nonce', nonce);
            return nonce;
        }
        return localStorage.getItem('nonce');
    }

    // Verify the nonce once user has authenticated.
    // If the nonce can't be verified we'll log the user out
    verifyNonce(nonce: string) {
        if (nonce !== localStorage.getItem('nonce')) {
            localStorage.removeItem('id_token');
            localStorage.removeItem('token');
        }
        this.router.navigate(['/grocery-list']);
    }

    user(): User {
        return this._user;
    }

    loggedIn() {
        return tokenNotExpired();
    }
}
```

From now on, the authentication process will be handled by [Auth0 Hosted Lock, a solution provided by Auth0 that makes easy securing websites](https://auth0.com/lock). To use the hosted solution we need to redirect the user to `http://{YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN}/authorize` with a few query parameters. These parameters are filled by the methods that we have just defined.

Now we need to update the `src/client/app/app.component.html` file by removing the `Sign Up` link, that is leading to a component that we already removed, and updating the `Sign In` link to redirect the user to Auth0 Hosted Lock. Update this file as follows:

{% highlight html %}
<nav class="navbar navbar-default">
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Brand and toggle get grouped for better mobile display -->
        <div class="navbar-header">
            <a class="navbar-brand" [routerLink]="['']"></a>
        </div>
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav pull-right">
            <li>
                <a *ngIf="!authenticationService.loggedIn()" href="https://{YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN}/authorize?scope=openid%20email&audience=grocery-list-api&response_type=id_token%20token&client_id={YOUR-CLIENT-ID}&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback&nonce={{nonce}}">Log In</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</nav>
<section>
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</section>
{% endhighlight %}

> **Important**—replace `{YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN}` above by your Auth0 domain (something like `bkrebs.auth0.com`) and `{YOUR-CLIENT-ID}`, with the *Client Id* of the *Grocery List API (Test Client)* client that was automatically created by Auth0.

When a user successfully signs in to Lock, Auth0 will redirect them to the `http://localhost:3000/callback` URL, which was defined as the `redirect_uri` parameter in the link above. So, we must create a new Angular component to handle this URL. The following code exhibits the content of the component that we must create in the `src/client/app/callback.component.ts` file:

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthenticationService } from './authentication.service';

@Component({
    template: ``
})
export class CallbackComponent {

    constructor(private authService: AuthenticationService) {
        this.authService.getIdToken();
        this.authService.getAccessToken();
    }
}
```

The `CallbackComponent` must also be registered in the `src/client/app/app.routing.ts` file, as below:

```
import {RouterModule} from "@angular/router";

import {GroceryListComponent} from "./grocery-list/grocery-list.component";
import {AuthenticatedGuard} from "./authenticated.guard";
import {CallbackComponent} from "./callback.component";

const APP_ROUTES = [{
    path: 'grocery-list',
    component: GroceryListComponent,
    canActivate: [AuthenticatedGuard]
}, {
    path: 'callback', // CallbackComponent is activated on calls to /callback
    component: CallbackComponent,
}];

export const Routing = RouterModule.forRoot(APP_ROUTES);
```

And on `AppModule`, as shown below:

```ts
// ... other imports
import {CallbackComponent} from "./callback.component";

@NgModule({
    bootstrap: [ AppComponent ],
    declarations: [
        AppComponent, GroceryListComponent, CallbackComponent // new component
    ],
    imports: [
        BrowserModule, HttpModule, FormsModule, Routing
    ],
    providers: [
        { provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: GlobalErrorHandler },
        AuthenticationService,
        AuthenticatedGuard,
        AUTH_PROVIDERS
    ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Besides that, we have to update the grocery list component to use the new route that we have created on our backend. We will make three changes to this component:

1. We will make it implements `OnInit` lifecycle hook, which will trigger the ajax request to the newly created route that responds with the users grocery list.
2. We will add a new private property called `getList` that represents the path to this new route.
3. We will implement a private method `loadList()` that issues the HTTP request to this new route and returns an observable that is consumed by `ngOnInit` method.

This three changes will result in the following code:

```typescript
import {Component, OnInit} from "@angular/core";
// ... other imports
import {Response} from "@angular/http";
import {Observable} from "rxjs";

@Component({
    // ... component declaration
})
export class GroceryListComponent implements OnInit {
    private updateList = '/api/update-list';
    private getList = '/api/list';
    newItem: string;

    constructor (private authenticationService: AuthenticationService, private authHttp: AuthHttp) { }

    ngOnInit(): void {
        this.loadList().subscribe(items => this.getUser().items = items);
    }

    private loadList(): Observable<string[]> {
        return this.authHttp.get(this.getList)
            .map((res:Response) => res.json())
            .catch((error:any) => Observable.throw(error.json().error || 'Server error'));
    }

    // ... other methods: updateUsersList, getItems, addItem, removeItem and getUser
}
```

Having updated the `GroceryListComponent` we are almost done. The last thing that we have to do is to make `AppComponent` generate a nonce for us through the `generateNonce` method that we have created on `AuthenticationService`. Let's open the `src/client/app/app.component.ts` file and update it as follows:

```typescript
import {Component, ViewEncapsulation} from "@angular/core";
import {AuthenticationService} from "./authentication.service";

@Component({
    // ... component definition
})
export class AppComponent {
    title = 'Grocery List';
    nonce: string;

    constructor(private authenticationService: AuthenticationService) {
      this.nonce = this.authenticationService.generateNonce();
    }
}
```

We are now ready to run our Grocery List application with Auth0 identity management. By issuing `npm run dev` command we shall be able to use it, accessing it on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), and sign in with Google or any other e-mail address as before.

Now if you want to add another identity provider, like Twitter, you just have to go to Auth0's dashboard and configure it. No changes to the source code are needed. Sweet, right?

> Auth0 provides the simplest and easiest to use [User interface tools to help administrators manage user identities](https://auth0.com/user-management) including password resets, creating and provisioning, blocking and deleting users.

## Conclusion

As we could see, writing Koa web servers is very easy and we achieve very clean code through the use of `async` functions. It is almost as if we were reading code that runs entirely synchronous. Also, by using TypeScript on both the backend and the front-end, our code becomes more readable and reliable, due to the type safe approach of this programming language.

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="Using TypeScript on both backend and front-end makes our code readable and reliable." %}

Allied to that, we can see that although these technologies are relatively new, we already have support to a lot of things, like securing the communication with JWT tokens.
