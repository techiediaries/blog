## Memex (from Vannevar Bush)

The idealizer (synonym?).

## Tim Berners Lee HTTP 1989

The first implementation.

## HTTP Formalization 1990

The first formal definition.

## HTTP 1.1 1997

The second, and still used, definition and implementation.

## REST Debut

Roy Fielding addresses REST on his doctoral dissertation entitled "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures".

> Is this doctoral dissertation a boring read?

## REST Definitions

### Resources

### Representations

### HATEOAS

## REST Constraints

### Client-Server Communication

### Stateless

### Cache

### Uniform Interface

- URI
- Resources are managed through its representations
- Auto descriptive messages
- HATEOAS

### Layered System

### On-Demand Code

## HTTP APIs

What HTTP APIs that consider themselves REST APIs usually miss?

- Resources are managed through its representations
- Auto descriptive messages
- HATEOAS

Are there any alternative to HATEOAS?

## Aside: Securing RESTful and HTTP APIs with Auth0

## Conclusion
